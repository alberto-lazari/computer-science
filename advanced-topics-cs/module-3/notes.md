# Introduction
## Trade-offs
GDPR introduced two requirements in algorithmic design
1. Interpretability
2. Privacy

Requirements have trade-offs with analysis accuracy

Differential privacy (DT): formal quantification of privacy by mathematically provable definition

DT can be viewed as amount of noise to introduce in an algorithm to hide an individual participation

Privacy vs model accuracy is solved with small models (less noise) that use a lot of publicly available data (less privacy concerns)

## What about the interpretability?
Study trade-offs between the three
