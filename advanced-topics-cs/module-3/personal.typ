I think the paper provides a very useful and interesting improvement in the theory of ML systems.
What I find particularly interesting is the fact that it is not an incremental step over an already established concept.
The authors really tried to provide an alternative to other models, but thinking outside of the box to give an answer to modern constraints and requirements, like GDPR.

I particularly enjoy the simplicity of the model: it's minimal and intuitive, which can help to better shape future extensions and improvements.

I think that starting to build the model with privacy and interpretability in mind should be the standard, for legal and requirements reasons, but also because from there it's possible to build more efficient and accurate implementations, while it's more difficult to increment privacy and interpretability aspects, once a model is well established and implemented in various forms.

The only disadvantage I found in the LLM model is that it seems to be _too simplistic_.
As the authors allude in the conclusion, it is yet to be seen whether the model is capable of keeping the accuracy high, even with more complex data.
