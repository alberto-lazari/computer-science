## (Ionic) Capacitor
- The equivalent of Electron on Desktop for mobile apps. Turns an existing web app into a mobile app
- You can use any frontend framework. It's just a node module/js library you install into your project
- Successor of Cordova? Basically the same, but born in 2018 vs 2009
- From Ionic, but does not require to use it. Ionic provides the UI elements (buttons, input, ...) Capacitor is the tool to compile and bundle the web app into a native mobile app and provides access from the web app to mobile specific features (camera, storage, location, ...)

## NativeScript
