# NativeScript
Open-source framework to build cross platform applications using JavaScript

# Interpreted
## Runtimes
- Allow to call native APIs from JavaScript code
- Code not compiled, nor transpiled. JavaScript runs directly on the system JSVMs
- No browser needed

## Plugins
Core Modules and other plugins provide cross-platform abstractions for native UI components. Built with JavaScript (or TypeScript), can include native libraries, usually community-driven

## Application code
Can be written with any framework, or just defining UI elements using XML files

# Motivations
- App code with anything
- While keeping native look and feel
- Capacitor is a viable solution for better performance with compilation
