# Markup languages current state
- TeX and LaTeX as main typesetting environment of the last 40+ years
- Markdown as an easy and (too) simple alternative. Mainly intuitive and lightweight syntax (also not GBs of installation)
- Typst as a typesetting language at its core, but also a simple markup language on the surface

## Typst syntax modes
- Markup
- Math
- Code

# Markup mode
But wasn't the presentation about programming languages?
Actually, everything's a function and modes are just a syntactic sugar for (pure) function calls

- Content type
- Blocks (default markup)

# Code
- Type system
- Functions
    - Layers of the language: computational (only see this), presentational, structural
    - Value types (no reference types): reference counting in the implementation, to avoid unnecessary copies
- Methods
- Joining

## Set/show rules?

# Compiler
- Dynamic typing
- Modules
- Multiple rounds of compilation (introspection)

# New vs old
Comparisons between the Typst way and LaTeX, highlighting the rigidity of macros and simplicity of a complete syntax

- Syntax: consistency and syntactic sugars
- Diagnostic
- Automatability and computational foundations
