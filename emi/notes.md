# 2. Innovation

## Creativity
Produce useful and novel work

### Individual
- Intellectual abilities
- Knowledge: balanced, not too little nor too much (paradigms)
- Personality: overcome obstacles and take risks
- Motivation: intrinsic, not extrinsic (money)
- Environment: cultural rewarding

### Organizational
- Creatividty of individuals
- Interaction and behaviour between individuals

How to encourage:
- Idea collection system (suggestion box)
- Training
- Cultural encourage

## R&D (Research and Development)
In firms research can be:
- Basic: no immediate commercial application
- Applied

Comes from:
- Science push
- Customer pull: have deep understanding of their needs

Development apply knowledge to make product or processes

## Technology clusters
Firms of a common technology geographically close

Pros:
- Frequent knowledge transfer
- Agglomeration economies: infrasrtucture improvements in the region

Cons:
- Reduced pricing power: shared knowledge
- High housing costs, traffic, pollution

## Knowledge brokers
Transfer innovation from one field (domain) to an unrelated one

---
# 3. Types of innovation
Usually 4:
- Product | process: one can imply the other. A product for someone can be a process for others
- Radical | incremental
- Competence (enhancing | destroying)
- Architectural | component: modular or not. Compatible with existing technology

## Technology S-curves
Technology improvement could be described as the graph of the function
```
performance = invest(effort) < technology limit
```

The function has an S shape, with the fastest growth in the middle

Diffusion S-curves depend on improvement S-curves

## Innovation adopters categories
- Innovators
- Early adopters
- Early majority
- Late majority
- Laggards

A firm should adopt an innovation thinking of:
- Advantages
- Switch effort
- Fit with current abilities (effort to learn new ones)
- Complementary resourced possessed
- Competitive dynamics

## Technology cyle
Two different points of view

### Utterback & Abernathy
1. Fluid phase: technology is still uncertain
2. Specific phase

### Anderson & Tushman
1. Era of ferment: introduction of new technological discontinuity
2. Dominant design: one finally emerges
3. Era of incremental change: focus on efficiency, rather than novelty

---
# 4. Competition
- Absortive capacity: the ability to recognize, assimilate and utilize new knowledge
- Prior learning: experience in a particular technology
-> technology adopter earlier will be better developed

## Network externality
Benefit from great installed base, important when there are compatibility and complementary goods concerns.

This leads to self reinforcing cycle

## Dominant design
Could be selected by:
- Market: early technology with huge installed base, important sponsors. It prevents potentially superior technologies to emerge
- Governments: societal welfare on having compatibility

The total value of a product is standalone value + network externalities

## Alternatives to actual good product
- Mindshare: marketing
- Vaporware: pre-advertising, hype

## Platform ecosystems
Provide a core to mediate a modular ecosystem, where more firms contribute to the value of the platform

Modularity is relevant where there are various options and customer preferences are different. If there is it needs standardization

---
# 6. Strategic direction
First: evaluation of firm's environment

## External analysis
Porter's five forces model:
1. Existing rivalry
    - number and size of existing firms
    - how similar they are
    - product demand
    - exit barriers (?)
2. Potential entrants
3. Suppliers power
4. Buyers power
5. Substitutes threat: close products

### Stakeholder analysis
- Strategic: how stakeholders will impact performance
- Normative: ethical/moral implications

## Internal analysis
1. Identify strenghts and weaknesses in primary and secondary activities
2. Identify potential (sustainable) competitive strenghts that are:
    - rare
    - valuable
    - durable
    - inimitable

### Core competencies
Abilities that distinguish a firm in the market. Response to changes and new opportunities, can be:
- Rigid
- Dynamic

Ex: Apple (advertising, design), Amazon (logistics management, cloud computing)

### Strategic intent
Long term ambitious goal:
- Built upon core competencies
- Ahead of 10 to 20 years
- Need to fill resources and competencies gap

## Red/blue ocean strategy
- Red: emerge as the best in an existing market. Beat the competition
- Blue: claim unexplored markets. Be the first in that field

---
# 8. Collaboration strategy
It makes sense to go solo when:
- You have all the necessary competencies and resources
- It's too dangerous to give knowledge to another firm
- There's no appropriate partner

And you need:
- Strong competencies
- Access to capital
- Not to be under time pressure

Collaboration can lead to:
- Faster developing times
- Less resource commitment
- New knowledge acquired
- Creation of shared standards

## Types of collaborations
- Strategic alliances: demanding but faster, cheaper and less risky. Can combine complementary competencies or transfer them. They can be a network of alliances
- Joint ventures: equal investment to (usually) create a separate entity
- Licensing: an IP to someone. Limited control over the technology
- Outsourcing: one gives services to the other
- Collective research organizations

### Partner selection
A bad partner could:
- Have unfitting resources
- Use company's knowledge with little reciprocal contribution -> alliance contracts specify rights and obligations
- Have unfitting strategy: same objectives lead to competition

Important to limit collaborations or they will be difficult to manage

---
# 9. Protection
Helps retain control and rents from innovations

Various options to protect IPs

## Patents
- Granted by governments
- Exclude others from produce, use or sell patented invention
- Must be useful, novel and not obvious

Three different kinds of patents:
- Utility: processes, machines, manufactured items or combination of materials
- Design: original items ornaments
- Plant: new varieties of plants

Each country has specific patent laws, but treaties:
- Paris Convention for Protection of Industrial Property: apply as another country's own citizen and use original submission date (within a specific time period)
- Patent Cooperation Treaty: more uniform process in a single application to more than 150 countries for up to 2.5 years

### Application
Requires drawings, descriptions and explanation of use. During the examination there's a publication period where others can challenge the patent. Granted when all tests passed.

For the approval the patent can't be trivial: natural laws, changin materials, size, shape, portability

### Strategies
Patent trolling:
- Limit option of competitors
- Aggressive lawsuits

## Trademarks
Symbols (word, design, phrase) used to distinguish source of good between companies. Need to be registered before suit and to establish international rights

Treaties in the Madrid Union to simplify international registration:
- Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks
- Madrid Protocol

## Copyrights
Prohibits:
- Reproduce copies
- Prepare derivatives
- Distribute copies for sale, rental or lease
- Publicly perform/display the work

Can be used for 'fair use'. After 1978 copyright is valid for author's life + 70 years

Berne convention: minimum level of protection in all countries and no different rights for foreigners

## Trade secrets
Can avoid to specify detailed information in patent
Information must be:
- Not generally known or obtainable
- A distinctive advantage
- Protected with reasonable measures

## Proprietary/open
Systems can be:
- Wholly proprietary: rents, development and evolution control
- Degrees of licencing
- Wholly open: rapid and vast adoption, external development

# 11. New Product Development (NPD) processes
Objective to pursue:
- Customer requirements fit
- Minimal cycle time
- Development costs

## Methods
- Parallel development process
- Project champions: place senior executive to lead the project. Can lead to fear to challenge senior judgment -> Anti-campion
- Involving customers in development: use lead users instead of random sample. Crowdourcing is an option
- Involving suppliers: they can suggest alternatives to reduce cost. Better coordination in supply. Leads to less time, cost and higher quality
- Use tools

### Tools for improving NPD processes
- Stage gate: Time and cost escalete on each stage -> Multi functional review before starting new stage
- House of quality, Quality Function Deployment (QFD)
- Failure Modes and Effetcs Analysis (FMEA): severity score (1-5) on:
    - severity
    - likelihood
    - difficulty to detect
- CAD (Computer Aided Design): inexpensive prototyping
- CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing)

---
# 12. NPD teams
Need to consider different parameters

## Size
- Pros: greater performance than individuals, more expertise
- Cons: administrative costs, communication problems, shared sense of identity, social loafing (less individual effort)

## Composition
- Pros: more knowledge, coordination between different departments (functional areas), cross fertilization of ideas
- Cons: coordination and communication, not cohesive -> long-term contact

## Structure
Four possible types:
- Functional: specialized on functional area. No project manager. Lacks cross-functional integration
- Lightweight: functional with project manager (junior) as coordinator of different teams
- Heavyweight: functional heads work with project manager (senior), that has authority -> more commitment
- Autonomous: only long-term team. Potential conflict between teams, growth of functional divisions. For major projects

## Leadership
Team leaders direct activities to goal and communicates with senior management. More influence in team performance than champions

## Administration
Members have focus and commitment on objectives:
- Project charter
- Contract book
- Project plan
These describe the project and the objectives

### Virtual teams
Members comfortable with technology, strong interpersonal skills, work ethic and independence

Four different types:
- Decentralized teams: loose coordination -> modular innovations
- Central integrator
- Small core team -> architectural innovations
- Centralized team: the teams provide all the R&D resources to the centralized venture team. Most expensive -> strategic innovations

## Other considerations
- Brainstorming kills creativity:
    - Judgment
    - Less thinking in group
    - Feasability
