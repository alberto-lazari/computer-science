# Impossible Foods vs Motif FoodWorks
Motif was founded in 2018, Impossible heme patent was filed in 2016.
Motif currently sells [Motif BeefWorks](https://madewithmotif.com/products/finished-formats/), plant-based burger patties

## Impossible sues Motif
Impossible sued Motif on March 2022 (1.) claiming patent [US10,863,761](https://patents.justia.com/patent/10863761) was violated by Motif's Hemami ingredient ([launched](https://madewithmotif.com/2021/06/22/motif-foodworks-previews-transformative-food-technologies-for-meat-alternatives-2/) on 22/06/2021 and [trademarked](https://madewithmotif.com/2021/12/08/unlocking-taste-and-flavor-hemami-2/) on 8/12/2021, apparently?), that is made through fermentation using yeast, same process of Impossible's heme ingredient.

## Motif sues Impossible
Motif does not negate, it just claims that the ingredients Impossible discovered had already been sold in food for decades, thus the pantent should have never granted in the first place, because they are not patentable, as obvious inventions. On 26 October 2022 PTAB declined to review the case.

# EPO labels patent obvious
On 30 November 2022 European Patent Office (EPO) revokes EU patent [EP2,943,072](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/053675762/publication/EP2943072A2?q=pn%3DEP2943072A2), [claiming that it is obvious](https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2022/12/07/Heme-proteins-Impossible-Foods-EU-patent-revoked-US-IP-dispute-with-Motif-FoodWorks-ramps-up#eztoc_3_1_1) (3rd condition to approve a patent, chapter 9, slide 7).

Motif:
> We agree with the European Patent Office’s ruling that Impossible’s patent is obvious
